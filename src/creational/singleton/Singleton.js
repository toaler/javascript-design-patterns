/**
 *     It consists of constructor and two class methods called getPropertyByName and setPropertyValue. Both of these
 *     class method are pretty self explanatory: one gets the property's value and the other sets its value.
 *
 *     Next, we have the constructor function. It is a function that gets invoked whenever we create a new of object of
 *     this class.
 *
 *     But here is a catch: for a class to be a singleton we need to make sure that it creates only one instance, and
 *     that's all.
 *
 *     To make sure that this happens, we simply create a global variable called instance. We define it at the top of
 *     the module. This variable acts as a checker. We add a condition in the constructor function such that if instance
 *     variable has any value (that is, the object of the StateUtility class) then throw an error or else assign
 *     instance to the current class instance (the this object).
 *
 *     In this example, we implemented the class StateUtility so that it can expose and alter the globalState variable.
 *
 *     We make sure that we don't expose the globalState. We expose them using the class methods of StateUtility. In
 *     this way, we protect the global state from being altered directly.
 *
 *     Finally, we create the instance of the class as follows:
 *       let stateUtilityInstance = Object.freeze(new StateUtility());.
 *
 *     We have used Object.freeze so that no other class/component/module is able to modify the exposed
 *     stateUtilityInstance.
